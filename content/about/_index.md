I'm an IT architect at Info Support in The Netherlands. I've been a .NET developer for more than 10 years and have experience in building web scale applications including backend and frontend (web and mobile) development. I have a passion for improving productivity and quality for teams.

In addition to my day-to-day job I'm also an active open source contributor. I write blogs on anything related to .NET and I occasionally speak at local meetups and conferences.

Last but not least I also like to cook and drive my motorcycle.
