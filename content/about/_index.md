I'm a Solution Architect at R&R WFM based in Veenendaal, The Netherlands. I've been a .NET developer for more than 10 years and have a lot of experience in building web scale applications, including both frontend and backend development. I have a strong passion for making teams be as productive as they can possible be, by leveraging DevOps practices.

I also contribute to open source projects, including [Augurk](https://github.com/Augurk), [Ocelot](https://github.com/Ocelot) and of course [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet). I write blogs on anything related to Microsoft technologies and I speak at local meetups and conferences.

Finally I like to cook and drive my motorcycle.
